            Inc.<br> (TSLA) and CEO of the private space company SpaceX. Musk co-founded PayPal (PYPL), was an early
            investor in several tech companies, and in April 2022 he began negotiations for a deal to take Twitter Inc.
            (TWTR) private.<br>
            His success and personal style has given rise to comparisons to other colorful tycoons from U.S. history,
            including Steve Jobs, Howard Hughes, and Henry Ford.<br> He was named the richest person in the world with an
            estimated net worth of $220 billion as of June 2022.<br>
            Musk first achieved that distinction in 2021, surpassing Amazon.com Inc.<br> (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos.

            the charismatic chief executive of electric car maker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX, and has made a
            deal to buy Twitter.<br>
